This is a simple password generator built using Python. It asks the user to enter a desired password length and then generates a strong password using a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The program ensures that the password is at least 8 characters long for better security. It uses Python's built-in random and string modules to generate the password. This project is great for beginners learning how to use loops, functions, and basic input/output in Python. No extra libraries are required â€” just run the script and get your secure password instantly.
